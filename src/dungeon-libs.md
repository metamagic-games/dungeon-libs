*For 2+ players*

To play this game you need a large number or **D6**s (six-sided dice, preferably three per player), pencils and paper. Choose a player to be the **Skull Lord**, and the rest to be players. If you’re not the **Skull Lord**, stop reading here! 

The **Skull Lord** will run the game, describe the outcomes of player action, and arbitrate disputes. If you’re the **Skull Lord**, don’t tell your players what the game is about!



----------
## Character Creation

Tell each player them to number a sheet of paper 1 - 13. 

They must write a word of the following type after each number (do together):

1. Noun
2. Roll a D6 and write the number down (1-6)
3. Animal, vegetable, or mineral
4. Personality trait or emotion
5. Job
6. Noun
7. -ing verb (running, jumping, climbing, etc)
8. -ing verb
9. -ing verb
10. -ing verb
11. Adjective
12. Monster
13. -ing verb or noun

Players must then create a character sheet, using the information they wrote for each number.

Players start at level 1.

### Class

Your class is a *Noun from #1* *number from #2*. For #2:

1. Fighter
2. Thief
3. Wizard
4. Priest
5. Bard
6. Paladin

For example, a player that wrote *‘cheese’* for #1 and rolled a 3 for #2 would become a *Cheese Wizard*.

### Race

Your race is a *#3* *man/woman/person*. For example: *a dog man, a broccoli woman, or a granite person*.

### Background

Your background is a *#4* *#5*. For example: *an angry clerk*.

### Skills and equipment

Your ancestral weapon is a *#6* of *#7*. For example: *a spoon of jumping*.

Your skills are *#8 - #10*. Write +1 next to two and -1 next to one. For example: *swimming +1, cooking +1, flexing -1*.

Skills act as health, and each time a player takes damage they temporarily lose one skill. If a player has no remaining skills, they are dead.

During play, you will gain **experience** and **shiny gold coins**. It might be useful to draw a box or space to track these. **Experience** is used to level up, and **shiny gold coins**. are used to buy items. Read each other your beautiful character sheets. If players draw a picture of their character, the **Skull Lord** can give them 1 **experience.**

#11-13 will be used during play.

You should now have a complete character. Now it’s time for adventure!


----------
## Playing the game

### The Quest

The story always goes the following way: 

- An *Adjective* *Noun* comes to the players while they are at a *Location*.
- This sorry soul has lost their *Adjective* *Noun* in the **Dungeon**!

For example, *a dirty peasant visits the players while they are in a tavern. This peasant has lost their delicious honey in the Dungeon*.

For finding it for him/her, the peasant will award the heroes a **shiny gold coin** each.

### The Dungeon

Each quest requires players to explore a dungeon, divided up into several dungeon floors. Each floor of the dungeon consists of a **challenge,** followed by an **encounter.** Create a single **challenge** and **encounter** for each floor the players reach (starting with the first one).

A dungeon with 3-4 floors works best for short games, but you can go longer if the players are having a good time.

If players survive the dungeon, they gain 1 **experience** and heal to full. A player that levels up to level 5 gains a special title, which you can **establish** with the group, such as *Master Grognard*, or *Dungeoneer*, or *Scream Lord*, or something.


\page

### Establishing

Sometimes, the players will have to make up the details about the world around them. For example, what’s peculiar about the room they’re in? Why is the person they’re talking to so unusual? 

Establishing means giving the **Skull Lord** information or details, ‘*filling in the blanks*’ or picking words for the challenges and dungeon. If the **Skull Lord** likes a player’s suggestion, they have **established** a detail.

A player gains 1 **experience** each time they **establish** something for the **Skull Lord**.

If your players are struggling, they can always use the **random word tables** at the end of this document (though they should not be rewarded with **experience**).


### Challenges

We need to find out what lies in store for the players. Roll **2D6** to discover the players’ **challenge**:


1. -
2. A deadly trap!
3. A tomb!
4. A door!
5. A hazard!
6. A prison!
7. A fork in the corridor!
8. A room!
9. A puzzle!
10. A shrine!
11. The Shopkeeper!
12. Treasure!

The **Skull Lord** must have players **establish** the details about the challenges. For example, what kind of door are the heroes up against? *A spiked door, covered in flames*? *A door made entirely out of spiders*?

For inspiration, check out this bot: https://twitter.com/bot_teleport

### Fork in the corridor

Pick two *nouns*. Each room beyond this fork is associated with one of these words.

The players must decide whether to head to the left or the right.

### The Shopkeeper

**The Shopkeeper** is a mysterious being that is seemingly invulnerable and always has one weird quirk (players must **establish**) such as a *smiling mask*, a *sing-song voice*, etc.

You can use the following templates for items, either bought or found, or make your own:

- *Noun* of *Verb*-ing
- *Adjective* *Noun*
- *Noun* *Noun*
- *Noun* *Noun* of *Adverb*-ing

**The Shopkeeper** only stocks one or two magic items, and will sell them for **shiny gold coins**. Items can be normal, +1, or +2 in power. Items worth more **shiny gold coins** will have more nouns and adjectives. 

Players can only encounter **the Shopkeeper** once per **dungeon** but he/she can always be found in town. If players roll to meet the shopkeeper twice in a dungeon, roll again.

### Overcoming Challenges

During the course of a game, players will explore a dungeon. On each floor, players will come up against **challenges**. To overcome these **challenges**, players must roll **2D6**. If they have a relevant skill or weapon, they add or subtract the respective number to the total, even if the skill or weapon gives a penalty.

If the player can explain to the **Skull Lord** how their class, race, or background will help them and the game master agrees, they can roll **3D6** and pick the highest two results.

The result of your roll will always be the following:

- 10+ is a total success, with no downsides
- 7-9 is a success, but something bad or humiliating also happens such as getting stabbed, dropping or breaking your weapon, stepping on another character’s foot, falling down a crevasse, etc. This might involve taking damage.
- 2-6 is an unequivocal failure, and you will always take damage and get humiliated

You only have to roll for a challenge, or else something that the **Skull Lord** deems sufficiently challenging. The details of the outcomes of these rolls depend on what sort of challenge you are facing, whether it be combat, opening a door, jumping across a chasm, or checking a chest for traps. 

If a character takes damage, they cross out one of their skills, and it can no longer be used. Once they cross out all three skills, they are dead! 

### Encounters

After each **challenge**, the players will always encounter a **Monster** which they must fight in order to reach the next floor of the dungeon. 

Ask players for their #11 - #13. The monsters are always *#11* *#12* with the power of *#13*). For example: *A friendly cockatrice with the power of coffee*.

Defeating a monster is the same as defeating a challenge, but requires a number of successful rolls equal the floor number (so 1 successful roll on floor 1, 6 successful rolls on floor 6, etc.). The player who defeats a monster gets 1 **experience** and a **shiny gold coin** or possibly a new magic item.

The **Skull Lord** can also ask for the group to **establish** more monster powers if things are getting too easy. 

The final monster will be guarding the object of the player’s search, which they must retrieve safely.

### Experience and shiny gold coins

A player gains 1 **experience** when they defeat a challenge, but only the player that rolled. All players gain 1 **experience** if they survive the dungeon. A player gains 1 **experience** each time they **establish** something for the **Skull Lord.**

Once a player reaches 5 experience, they **level up**! They can either regain a crossed out skill (heal), increase one of their skills by +1, to a maximum of +3, or erase a skill and gain an entirely new skill that the rest of the group chooses for them.


\page

Players may also gain **shiny gold coins** in the dungeon or by defeating challenges. **Shiny gold coins** can be spent at **the Shopkeeper** to purchase new items. I like to use actual coins (please use pennies) to represent these coins. When a **shiny gold coin** drops, the first player to either grab it (if you’re using actual coins/pennies) or say the words ‘I grab it’ gets the loot. If this gets too violent, play rock-paper-scissors.

----------
## Advanced Play

Serious players only.

If players have already played this game, then you can have them complete character creation as normal, but everyone passes their paper left at the same time after everyone finishes writing each word. The paper players end up with is the one that they play with.

### Impaired!

If players get messed up or do something really hard or fail a roll you can count them as impaired for their next 2-3 rolls (they roll **3D6** and pick the lowest). Impaired gets canceled out to a normal roll if you would roll **3D6** and pick highest and vice versa

### SKULL WIZARDS!

If you want to add an extra challenge, you can instead make the final boss of a dungeon a legendary **Skull Wizard**. A **Skull Wizard** has no mercy! A skull wizard always requires a number of successes equal to the number of players at the table. In addition, any roll of less than a 10+ against a **Skull Wizard** is **instant death**!

To make a skull wizard, it’s use the following template:

- Legendary *Adjective* Skull Wizard *Name*!
- *He/She/They* wild the *Adjective* power of < *-ing verb*!

### CLASS POWERS!

If you want to really confuse people, each class gets a special power!


#### FIGHTER

Gain double **experience** and an extra **shiny gold coin** when you personally defeat a challenge or monster.

#### THIEF

Steal 1 item from anything or anyone per dungeon. Nobody can stop you, and nobody can steal it back once stolen, not even **the Shopkeeper** or another thief!

#### WIZARD

You gain the terrifying power to TRANSFORM! When you use this power, you first choose what you want part of your body to transform into, then your group **establishes** what part of your body transforms.

#### PRIEST

You can **pray to god** and turn any roll into a coin flip, treating a tails as a 2-6 and a heads as a 10+

#### BARD

Gain double **experience** for **establishing** by singing or using a sing-song voice

#### PALADIN

Once per dungeon you can **resurrect** a dead character, bringing them back to life and restoring them to full health. However, they must erase all their former skills and gain 3 entirely new skills, which are **established** by the group.
